## Cipher AI Vault Data Store Canister

### Getting Started:

#### Dependencies:

To compile, use, or deploy this project you will need NodeJS, NPM, and DFX. Azle will install the rest of the necessary components and dependencies upon first build.

#### Install Packages:

```
npm install
```
Note: The default canister name is 'backend'. You can change that by modifying the dfx.json file's canister section. If you modify it and plan to deploy on the mainnet make sure you also edit the canister_ids.json file otherwise it will create another new canister for you.

#### Building With Azle:

Once you are done writing your TypeScript functions, just run:

```
npm run build
```

If you are running Azle for the first time or have just switched versions, Azle will go ahead and attempt to install all of the necessary rust and wasm components it needs to get the job done, this may take anywhere from 5-15 minutes depending on network speed and compute capability. This will only happen if you have never used this version of Azle yet. After it is done, it will build the canister as normal.

#### Installing Your Wasm To A Canister:

After creating a canister either locally or on the mainnet you can use the following command to deploy your canister smart contract. The default dfx deploy command will not work due to the default wasm payload being over 2MB. To avoid the error and install the wasm directly use:

```
dfx canister install backend --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/backend.wasm.gz --mode reinstall -y
```

If you have already created a mainnet canister and wish to deploy to the network just add `--network ic` after `canister` in the command.

## Useful Test Commands:

Hereâ€™s the updated list of DFX command-line test commands using your principal (`principal`):

### Authorization and Management

1. **Check Authorization:**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call backend isAuthorized
   ```

2. **Reset Canister Data:**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call backend resetCanister
   ```

3. **Delete User Data (for authorized users only):**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call backend deleteUserData '( "principal" )'
   ```

### Queries

4. **Check if Data Map is Empty:**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call backend isDataMapEmpty
   ```

5. **Fetch All User Data:**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call backend getAllUserData
   ```

6. **Fetch Data for a Single User:**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call backend getSingleUser '( "principal" )'
   ```

7. **Fetch File Data for a User's File:**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call backend getFileData '( "principal", "file-12345" )'
   ```

8. **Check if a User Exists:**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call backend doesUserExist '( "principal" )'
   ```

### Updates

9. **Create a New User Entry:**
   ```bash
   dfx canister --network ic call backend createUserEntry
   ```

10. **Add a File to User:**
    ```bash
    dfx canister --network ic call backend addFileToUser '( "principal", record { fileID = "file-12345"; fileName = "Project Plan"; fileData = vec { record { id = "1"; name = "First Entry"; description = "Details of first entry" } } } )'
    ```

11. **Update File for User:**
    ```bash
    dfx canister --network ic call backend updateFileForUser '( "principal", record { fileID = "file-12345"; fileName = "Updated Project Plan"; fileData = vec { record { id = "1"; name = "Updated Entry"; description = "Updated details" } } } )'
    ```

12. **Remove a File from User:**
    ```bash
    dfx canister --network ic call backend removeFileFromUser '( "principal", "file-12345" )'
    ```

13. **Add Data to a File for a User:**
    ```bash
    dfx canister --network ic call backend addDataToFile '( "principal", "file-12345", record { id = "2"; name = "Second Entry"; description = "Details of second entry" } )'
    ```

14. **Update Data for a File for a User:**
    ```bash
    dfx canister --network ic call backend updateDataForFile '( "principal", "file-12345", record { id = "1"; name = "Updated Entry"; description = "Updated details of first entry" } )'
    ```

### Example Mock Values:
- **User Principal:** `"principal"`
- **File ID:** `"file-12345"`
- **File Name:** `"Project Plan"` / `"Updated Project Plan"`
- **Data Entries:**
  - `record { id = "1"; name = "First Entry"; description = "Details of first entry" }`
  - `record { id = "2"; name = "Second Entry"; description = "Details of second entry" }`

You can replace these mock values to suit your specific testing needs.
